implemented in minetest. This mod is unfinished.

# How to use

## Collect model information

* Build an input model in the sky
* Select a WorldEdit region (set the two positions) around the built model;
  there should be many air nodes included at the borders of the region.
* Run the `//gen_mi <name>` chatcommand


## Generate/Synthesize a model

* Select some WorldEdit region; it should be big enough for the model to fit in
* Run the `//synth <name>` chatcommand
